# Simple "To Do List" project

This is a simple application which I developed using react.js.

I used localstorage to store the necesary data for the application.

This was inspired by the React JS crash course video of Traversy Media (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=4600s).

Have fun with it!
